This was my very first exam during my Front-End Development studies at Noroff. I built a website for a museum. Feel free to check it out if you're curious!

Description:
<ul>
  <li>The page should suit kids age 7-15 years old, but also reach the parents.</li>
  <li>I wanted it to play playful and colorful, but still look professional.</li>
  <li>This was my first time working with grid-styling</li>
</ul>

Built With:
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
</ul>
